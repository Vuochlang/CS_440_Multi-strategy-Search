Given the folder with all files:

In the msttt.py, implement the 5 methods that are unimplemented:

    _ method 1: def is_win(self, tttnode),
        determines if the current board configuration is an end game, if any player has won or StaleMate
  
    _ method 2: def addtuples(t1, t2),
        Given two tuples, return a tuple represent the sum of both tuples.
    
    _  method 3: def bestchoice(t1, t2, whom),
        Given two tuples representing: (ties, p1-wins, p2-wins), return the 'best' choice for the player 'whom'.
        
    _ method 4: def count_outcomes(self, tttnode, verbose=False),
        Counts the distinct outcomes of tictactoe games starting from the 'tttnode.board' and return a tuple of (# of ties, # of X wins, # of O wins) for all possible
        games generated by starting at the initial state and playing until completion.
    
    _ method 5: def evaluate_strategies(self, tttnode, verbose=False),
        Given the 'tttnode', return a dictionary representing the strategic outcome table for a given input state (tttnode).
        dictionary = {'BB': (0, 0, 0), 'BR': (0, 0, 0), 'RB': (0, 0, 0), 'RR': (0, 0, 0) } where each tuple represents number of (ties, X-wins, O-wins).
